# test_2

A simple test project for learning and experimenting with **SDL3**, **C++**, and **Git**.  
This repository is intended as a sandbox for practicing basic C++ development, exploring SDL3 features, and getting comfortable with version control using Git and GitHub.

---

## Features

- Minimal C++ setup using CMake
- SDL3 integration for graphics and multimedia
- Basic project structure for experimentation
- Version control best practices with Git

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [CMake](https://cmake.org/) (version 3.x or higher)
- C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- [SDL3 development libraries](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL)

### Building the Project
